# Welcome to the UVIC ROBOTICS Rover page

A breakdown of the ROS Files will be in the wiki. The wiki should be updated so that people can get a clear understanding of what we are doing and what still needs to be done. 

## What this repository is supposed to be

This will be the home for all files relating to the Rover. This includes microcontroller code, configuration files for sensors, custom classes, and any packages that we create.
